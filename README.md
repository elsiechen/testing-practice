# Testing Practice

This project aims to enhance the testing process for functions by utilizing Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. By default, the current version of Jest does not support ES6 import statements. To overcome this limitation and enable the use of ES6 import statements with Jest, it is recommended to install Babel.

This project includes the following functions:<br>
- **capitalize function**: that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized
- **reverseString function**: that takes a string and returns it reversed
- **calculator object**: that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply
- **caesarCipher function**: that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”
- **analyzeArray function**: that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length
