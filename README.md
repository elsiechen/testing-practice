# Testing Practice

This project focus on writing tests for functions and writing functions to make the tests pass using **Jest**. By default, the current version of Jest will not recognize ES6 import statements, to solve the problem one should install **Babel** to accommodate ES6 import statements with Jest.

This project includes the following functions:<br>
- **capitalize function**: that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized
- **reverseString function**: that takes a string and returns it reversed
- **calculator object**: that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply
- **caesarCipher function**: that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”
- **analyzeArray function**: that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length
